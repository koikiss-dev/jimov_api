## **Overview**

This project is an open-source API for retrieving multimedia content such as anime, movies and series, news, and manga in both Spanish and English. The API is built using JavaScript and the Express.js framework. The API allows users to search for content by keywords and retrieve detailed information about the content such as title, description, and language. The API also allows users to filter results by language and content type.
